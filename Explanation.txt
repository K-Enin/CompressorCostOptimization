This folder contains the following Python scripts:
OptimizationNoPOC.py
OptimizationBonminNoPOC.py
OptimizationPOC_Upwind_Model.py
OptimizationBonmin.py
generateInitialData.py

The two optimization scripts 'OptimizationPOC_Upwind_Model.py' and
'OptimizationBonmin.py' run the compressor cost optimization, which is formulated using partial outer convexification. The two scripts 'OptimizationNoPOC.py' and
'OptimizationBonminNoPOC.py' (as the name states) do not use this reformulation. Additionally 'OptimizationNoPOC.py' is an NLP Problem.
The last script 'generateInitialData.py' was used to generate initial data for our examples.

How to run model: 
In this folder several Example-folders can be found. Each example folder contains the following files: eps_file.dat, P_time0.dat, Q_time0.dat, Edges.txt, Configs.txt and an illustration of the network. 
- eps_file.dat contains a 1xm vector of the mass flux taken out of the gas network to the slack bus for power conversion. It set beforehand or calculated using the scripts in power grid. 
- P_time0.dat and Q_time0.dat contains all pressure and flux values in time t=0 for every pipe section in every pipe (except the pipe which is connected to the slack bus, since its simulation is not important for the following gas pipe simulation).  
- Edges.txt contains all the dependencies between nodes. 
- Configs.txt contains several config parameters which characterize our gas network model.

For each type of Optimization Problem ab image folder is generated in the corresponding Example folder.

Remark: When solving the optimization problem with IPOPT we use library "ma27", which has to be installed externally and is not initially included in CasAdi. According to CasAdi Google Group library 'ma27' has a better performance for large nlp problems.
