In this folder several matlab-scripts are provided for solving the AC power flow equation. 
We use the power grid given in Paper [1] with the provided parameters. We solve the power-flow equation with matlabs build-in function 'fsolve' making use the of Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm.

In detail, the scripts are responsible for the following processes: 
In PowerModel.m we provide at slack, generator and load bus as well as the conductance matrix G and susceptance matrix B. As was modeled in [1], the initial conditions remain constant over time except for real and reactive power demand at node N5 which increases in the linearly increases in the interval [m/2,m/2+50] with m being the number of time steps.
This increase is modeled by 'generate_P_at_N5.m' for the real power and 'generate_Q_at_N5.m' the reactive power.
In 'RunPowerModel.m' we solve the Power Flow Equations for every time step by calling 'PowerModel.m' m-times. The reactive Power at N1 is then taken and converted to mass flow eps via:
eps = a_0 + a_1*P + a_2*P^2.
